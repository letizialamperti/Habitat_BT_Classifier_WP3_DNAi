# WP3 Development

Welcome to the WP3 Development repository. This project focuses on developing a Self-Supervised Learning model using the Barlow Twins method. Our approach enables the model to autonomously extract information and represent it in a reduced sample space. Key features include:

- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Employs the Barlow Twins method for efficient and independent information extraction.
- **Dynamic Weight Callback**: Utilizes the `dynamic_weight_callback` parameter to optimize the learning process.
- **Classification with MLP**: Activates the MLP classifier for classification tasks through the `classification_loss_weight` parameter.

Explore the repository to learn more about our methods, code implementation, and results.
